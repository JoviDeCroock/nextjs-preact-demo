# Preact example

This example uses [Preact](https://github.com/preactjs/preact) instead of React. It's a React like UI framework which is fast and small. Here we've customized Next.js to use Preact instead of React.

Here's how we did it:

- Use [preact-compat/react](https://github.com/preact-compat/react) to install Preact as React.
- Use an [npm alias]() to replace `react-ssr-prepass` with `preact-ssr-prepass` (also works with Yarn).

## How to use

Clone this repo and run `npm install`:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:developit/next-preact
```
